All About AWS Tags 

Sometimes it can be really hard to track down who is using the correct tags on AWS, especially when you have many people launching instances in different regions across the United States.

So, what strategy could you use to solve a problem of this kind?

Before we delve into this problem, let's understand why tagging is so important.

Here is a list of reasons. Please don't skip this part.

1. Tags can help you track cost
2. Tags can help you track AWS resource usage
3. Tags can help you find your own AWS resource easily
4. Tags can help you find whoever isn't tagging their resources

How to track cost by using tags.

There are two ways to track cost using

Cost Explorer

In AWS Services Billing, you can find Cost Explorer, which shows you month-date spendings and daily spendings. On the left side of Cost Explorer, you have the option of selecting which tags to filter, for example, Name: Sally. On top of the graph, you can even group the costs and usage by tag key.
This is very convenient because you can see how much is spent by each user.

Since each user could be running more than one instance at a time, we want the tag keys to be the following.

Name
Project
End_date

**The End_date is the end date of the project.

Another way to track cost by using tags is to go read the csv file that is saved everyday to the S3 bucket named AccountNumber-nameofpayer-utilization.
